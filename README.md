**Sightword Game** is an app for parents to use with their kids to practice sight words. The parent picks a list to play, shows the words to their child, and if they get all of them right, they get a badge for that list.

The non-admin user logs in and is brought to their dashboard. From here, the user can view the badges they've earned and pick a list to play. When the user selects a list, they show each word to their child and pick 'right' or 'wrong' based on the child's response. At the end of the game, if the child gets all the words right, then they get a badge for that list which shows up on the dashboard. If they miss any words, they are notified of how many they missed.

The admin logs in and is brought to the 'admin view' where they can create, delete, or update lists and/or badges.
